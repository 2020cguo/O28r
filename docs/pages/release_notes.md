### New and noteworthy

### Fixed Issues

*   pmd-core
    * [#1939](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/issues/1939): \[core] XPath expressions return handling


### API Changes

#### Deprecated API

##### Around RuleSet parsing

* {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactory %} and {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactoryUtils %} have been deprecated in favor of {% jdoc core::RuleSetParser %}. This is easier to configure, and more maintainable than the multiple overloads of `RuleSetFactoryUtils`.
* Some static creation methods have been added to {% jdoc core::RuleSet %} for simple cases, eg {% jdoc core::RuleSet#forSingleRule(core::Rule) %}. These replace some counterparts in {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactory %}
* Since {% jdoc core::RuleSets %} is also deprecated, many APIs that require a RuleSets instance now are deprecated, and have a counterpart that expects a `List<RuleSet>`.
* {% jdoc core::RuleSetReferenceId %}, {% jdoc core::RuleSetReference %}, {% jdoc core::RuleSetFactoryCompatibility %} are deprecated. They are most likely not relevant outside of the implementation of pmd-core.

##### Around the `PMD` class

Many APIs around PMD's entry point ({% jdoc core::PMD %}) have been deprecated, including:
* The contents of the packages {% jdoc_package core::cli %}, {% jdoc_package core::processor %}
* {% jdoc core::SourceCodeProcessor %}
* The constructors of {% jdoc core::PMD %} (the class will be made a utility class)
